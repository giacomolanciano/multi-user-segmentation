# Multi User Segmentation for Process-Based Habit Mining
I worked on this project in the context of the Excellence Track of the M.Sc. in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.
I collaborated with a research group of my department on the implementation of techniques for Process-Based Habit Mining in the context of Ambient Intelligence. In particular, I focused on facing the problem of tracking the actions of multiple users in a smart environment, analysing a raw sensor log.

details.
